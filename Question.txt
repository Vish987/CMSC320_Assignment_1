I am interested in taking CMSC320 because I want to learn about data science. I want to learn different ways to analyze data and understand this data. Additionally, I want to represent this data through various visualization techniques. This class is a requirement for the machine learning specialization, so I want to learn the relationship between data science and machine learning. Finally, data science is a useful skill to have and has become very popular as the field of computer science grows.
